# Weather Dashboard:
The objective of this assignment is to identify the developers skills as it relates to the his/her ability to retrie data from another application's API and use it within the context of their own application. Third-party APIs allow developers to access data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

The assignemnt seeks to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Also, I will use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for different cities and store the data in my `localStorage`.

## User Story:
As a world traveler, I want to be able to plan my trips with foresight and to see the weather conditions of the countries/cities I plan to visit (current and future conditions). I want the ability to enter an application and plan 5-days ahead. I want the application to store the last few cities I reviewed for ease of consultation. 

## Success Criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
